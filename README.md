Dress for the job you want, not the job you have” – this quote, from “Picture Perfect,” is as familiar as “Show Me the Money” – and far more impactful than you might think.”
Fashion is an art form that enhances our life, not only does it allow you to dress up, play and have fun, but gives you the opportunity to tap into your own creativity and be free and independent in the way you express yourself.
